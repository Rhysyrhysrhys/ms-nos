- ignore messages too old! (this will come with the new messaging protocol)

- connection timeout on the proxy!!! (when I proxy an API behind a firewall) It gets a 502 but it takes 40+40seconds

- on timeout it should fail the very first time! Why do we return a 302 when the call fails? I thiknk it's because we classify it as temporary



--------------------------------
Core routing rules

Rings:
- A,B
- C,D
- F,G
- H,I

A,B----- C,D ----- F,G
             |
             ----- H,I
   
A needs to send to D
- A UDP
- B HTTP C
- C UDP

A needs to send to D
- A UDP
- B HTTP C
- C UDP
- D HTTP F
- F UDP

Anything message for an agent X (not me) I receive:
- if X is connected to me I send it directly trough HTTP with 0 hops
- if X is in my ring I broadcast with 1 hop trough UDP
- if X is in a ring I am connected to I send it via HTTP with 3 hops
- if X is in a ring I am not connected to I send it via HTTP to all connected rings with 5 hops
I should not resend a message I already sent

-------------------------------

- APIs are not removed on microservice disconnect
Done, missing call in WWWGateway

- prefer NON FAULTY apis over GEOLOCATION (5 redirects over the same failing API, then 502???)
Done, CachingStrategy was holdiing even if API were faulty: they should invalidate the cache 

- should enquiry if agent without microservice (HealthChecker)
Done

- command line parsing in proy DOES NOT WORK!!!
Done, wrong config

- too aggressive enquiry of unknow agents
Sorted, now 30 seconds mast elapse
