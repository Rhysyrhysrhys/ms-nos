- command line parsing in proy DOES NOT WORK!!!

- connection timeout on the proxy!!! (when I proxy an API behind a firewall) It gets a 502 but it takes 40+40seconds

- on timeout it should fail the very first time! Why do we return a 302 when the call fails? I thiknk it's because we classify it as temporary
